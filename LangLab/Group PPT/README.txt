Rural_Livelihood::Resource_Degradation

Where does our trash go?

We love to buy a lot of stuff. The prime cause of our happiness lies in owning more and more stuff.
We keep buying and buying things everyday, yet our houses never get filled. Can anyone ever reason how such an occurence
is ever possible.
Yes\No. Its because we trash most of them. about 99% of the products that we buy in six months end up in garbage form.
And where does it all end up? It ends up mostly in the natural dustbins available to us. The rural villages.
Yes, it it the same place from where we extract resouces, double damage. All the shining promises of reusing and recycling
by the big companies now begin to look more dull. In such a form it causes pollution to the environment.
